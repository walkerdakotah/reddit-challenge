### Main Tools Used
-
1. React for UI view
2. Redux for state management 

### Additional Middleware/Dependencies 
-
##### Redux Thunk 
Redux Thunks for asynchronous requests. Thunks allow our action creators to dispatch the results of other action creators. We can delay the dispatch of an action while we wait for our API request to resolve with our data - or reject with an error and dispatch the appropriate action. 

### Leftover Todos
-
1. fix sorting feature
2. implement error catching in data fetching
